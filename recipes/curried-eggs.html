      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Curried eggs are a delicious protein-filled treat that can be enjoyed on sandwiches, in salads and other dishes. Or you can just eat them straight from a bowl. I'm not your mother.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>4 boiled eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 pot of water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 <abbr>tsp.</abbr> of curry powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 <abbr>tsp.</abbr> chilli powder (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring water to a boil on medium temperature. Make sure the water covers the depth of the eggs.</li>
        <li>Gently lower the eggs into the boiling water using a slotted spoon, without cracking them.</li>
        <li>Use a timer. You want exactly nine minutes for four eggs. When finished, remove with slotted spoon.</li>
        <li>Run the eggs under cold water for one minute to help prevent a green ring from forming around the yolk.</li>
        <li>Crack on the fat end of the eggs and de-shell them under cold water. Chop them up and throw them in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add mayonnaise, curry powder, and optional chilli powder to the eggs. Stir and mash with a fork until you get a consistency you like.</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      </ol>
