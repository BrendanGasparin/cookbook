      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>A basic two egg omelette. Serves 1 person.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. of milk</li>
        <li>1 heaped tsp. of butter</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl, add the milk, season with salt and pepper to personal taste, and beat that mix with a fork or whisk until it is a consistent colour with few or no transparent bits remaining.</li>
        <li>Heat a medium-sized pan (preferably non-stick and about 20cm at the base) over medium heat and melt the butter in it. Move the butter around the pan to coat it evenly.</li>
        <li>Add your egg mixture to the pan. As it cooks, use a spatula to push the cooked parts from the edge to the centre of the pan. Tilt and rotate the pan to distribute the egg evenly across the base.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are nearly set but still look moist you need to fold the omelette in half. If you want you can add extra fillings first, on one half of the omelette. Then fold the other half over onto it to create a semicircle.</li>
        <li>Let the folded omelette cook for around another minute then slide it out of the pan onto a plate and serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>Omelettes are best served hot, and most easily cooked one at a time if making more than one. The ingredients may be increased if you wish to create larger omelettes but this may also increase the likelihood of tearing the omelette when folding it.</p>
      <h3>Fillings</h3>
      <p>Omelettes cook quickly so the fillings should be prepared and cut up before cooking. They should be cut finely to prevent the omelette from tearing. Omelette fillings vary greatly. If serving for many people you may wish to have a filling station on hand.</p>
      <p>Fillings can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Ham</li>
        <li>Shallots</li>
        <li>Pan fried mushrooms</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Smoked salmon</li>
        <li>Olives</li>
        <li>Pre-cooked meat like bacon or chicken or prawns</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Get creative with your fillings! But remember to cook uncooked meat like chicken or prawns separately before putting them in your omelette!</p>
