      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Hard boiled eggs are a versatile food, welcome in salads, on their own, or as the base for curried or deviled eggs.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 to 4 boiled eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 pot of water</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring water to a boil on medium temperature. Make sure the water covers the depth of the eggs.</li>
        <li>Gently lower the eggs into the boiling water using a slotted spoon, without cracking them.</li>
        <li>Use a timer. You want exactly eight minutes for two eggs. If cooking four, add a minute. When finished, remove with slotted spoon.</li>
        <li>Run the eggs under cold water for one minute to help prevent a green ring from forming around the yolk.</li>
        <li>Crack on the fat end of the egg and shell it under cold water, either after cooking or later if you want to refrigerate them.</li>
      </ol>
